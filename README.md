# KatanaUsdPlugins

The KatanaUsdPlugins were originally authored by Pixar and this repository was
originally based on the [v19.11] version of the USD library.

This section contains libraries and plug-ins for Katana. We have provided a new
build mechanism to modularize the building process, allowing the plug-ins to be
built against multiple compatible USD and Katana versions (depending on API
compatibility). There is a document attached to this repository
([BUILDING.md][Building]) which describes how to go about making
your own CMake build scripts.

See the [online documentation](http://openusd.org/docs/Katana-USD-Plugins.html)
for more details.

# Katana Plugins

The Katana Plugins originally authored by Pixar and this repository was
originally based on the 19.11 version of the USD library.
https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/releases/tag/v19.11

This section contains libraries and plugins for Katana. We have provided a new
build mechanism to modularize the building process.Allowing the plugins to be
built against multiple compatible USD and Katana versions; depending on API
compatibility. There is a document attached to this repository (BUILDING.md)
which describes how to go about making your own CMake build scripts.

See the [online documentation](http://openusd.org/docs/Katana-USD-Plugins.html)
for more details.
